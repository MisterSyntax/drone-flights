This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the project

In 3 seperate termnimals you'll need to run the following

### `./drone-sim`
- this fires up the drone sim endpoint

### `yarn start:gateway`
- fires up the api gateway so the browser can communicate with the drone sim endpoint

### `yarn start`
- fires up the app so you can fly some drones. You can view the app at http://localhost:3000/
